<!-- JS and the DOM -->

<!-- 
	READ THIS FIRST!

This file is an HTML file. You'll put your JS code for the exercises in a <scipt> tag at the bottom of this file.
Open this file in Google Chrome by opening Chrome, typing command-O, and selecting this file.
Or in Chrome you can use the menu bar by doing File -> Open.
As you add JS code to the file, you can refresh the page and see your code take effect.
You can also type your JS code in the Console tab of Chrome Developer Tools to see it take effect.

Note: Usually you would put your HTML and JS in separate files, but for simplicity we're 
putting them in the same file for this exercise.

Read through the HTML code given, then scroll down to the exercises below.
Type your JavaScript code for each exercise below each exercise description.
For this exercise, don't change the HTML code given.

<html>
  <body>
    Animals:
    <ol id="ol1">
      <li>Frog</li>
      <li>Dog</li>
      <li>Bunny</li>
    </ol>

    <div id="id1">
      <p>This is the text in div id1</p>
      <p>Hope you enjoy my HTML</p>
    </div>

    <p id="id2">Here's some text in a paragraph</p>

    <div class="myClass">I love learning about HTML and JavaScript</div>

    <p class="myClass">Coding is fun</p>

    <button id="button1">Button 1</button>
    <br /><br />
    <button id="button2">Button 2</button>
  </body>

  <script type="text/javascript">
    // Exercise 1: Select the element with id "id2" and change the text inside it to "Here's some new text"

    document.getElementById("id2").textContent = "Here's some new text";
 
    // Exercise 2: Select the element with id "id1" and make the text inside it green.
    document.getElementById("id1").style.color = "green";

    // Exercise 3: Select the elements that have the class "myClass". console.log the output.
   console.log(document.getElementsByClassName("myClass"));


    // Exercise 4: Select the children of the element with id "id1". console.log the output.
    console.log(document.getElementById("id1").children)

    // Exercise 5: Select all list items on the page. console.log the output.
    console.log(document.getElementById("ol1").textContent);

    // Exercise 6: Use JavaScript to find the *number* of list items on the page. console.log the output.
    console.log(document.getElementById("ol1").children.length)

    // Exercise 7: Using JavaScript, create a list item and add it to the end of the ordered list.
    const ol1 = document.getElementById("ol1");

    const newAnimal1 = document.createElement("li");
    const newAnimal2 = document.createElement("li");
    const newAnimal3 = document.createElement("li");
    newAnimal1.textContent = "cow"
    newAnimal2.textContent = "duck"
    newAnimal3.textContent = "llama"
    
   ol1.append(newAnimal1,newAnimal2,newAnimal3);

    //I might not need a function
    //I can update the textContent of ol1 to include my list items 

    // Exercise 8: Using JavaScript, make it so that when button1 is clicked,
    // an alert pops up saying "Hi from Techtonica".

    document.getElementById("button1").onclick = function(){
        window.alert("Hi from Techtonica");
    }

    // Exercise 9: In your own words, write a few sentences explaining what the DOM is. Write your answer in a comment below:
    // The DOM is the interactive interface that anyone design/manipulate to create interactive websites.

    // The next two exercises combine the DOM with other JavaScript you've learned. Try them for an extra challenge!

    // Exercise 10: Select the elements with the class "myClass" and update the text inside each of them to end with "!"
    // Hint: To operate on multiple elements, you can use a loop.

    const myClass = document.getElementsByClassName('myClass');

    Array.from(myClass).forEach(function(myClass){
        myClass.textContent += "!"; // using += we append the ! to the original content with the elements of class "myClass"
    })




    //I want to update the existing text content and add a "!"
    //first we are selecting the elements with the class name "myClass"
    //then we turn them into an array. 
    //the myClass.textContent will display the text from the elements with the class "myClass". 
    //the forEach loop will loop through the elements with the class "myClass"
    //console.log your changes before updating the HTML can be helpful to what will be updated



    // Exercise 11: Make it so when the button2 is clicked,
    // the children of the element with id "id1" each have their text replaced with a random number 1-100

    const id1 = document.getElementById("id1");
    const min = 1;
    const max = 100; 
    

    document.getElementById("button2").onclick = function(){
                for(child of id1.children){
                    child.textContent = Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min + 1) + min);
                }
       
    }

    /*const newElement = document.getElementById("id1");
    for(const child of newElement.children){
        console.log(child);
    } testing ways to access child elements */






    //create a variable for the id of button 2
    //will need an onclick attribute 
    //will update the text content of the children to a random numer, will need a random number generator (method)
    //will loop through the children to update them. 

    // How was this exercise (easy, hard, fun, confusing)?
    //This was so much fun, I enjoyed working on this exercise because it is bringing together everything we've been learning in Javascript and making it interactive. 
    //Also, this exercise was simple for me since I studied working with DOM in prior JS exercises.
